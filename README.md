# **Hello ðŸ‘‹**
Welcome to the testing space for the 2023 robotics season!

We are using the Java branch of the [WPILib framework](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/yearly-overview/index.html) to develop our code. The goal of this repository is to share the most basic fundamentals of robotics. Naturally, any code published here is:
- volatile
- experimental
- certainly **not** to be used in production

With that being said, there is still much that one can learn by skimming through the files. In case you need a quick refresher on the trivial aspects of [WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/yearly-overview/index.html)â€”or simply want to track our thought processâ€”this is the space for you.
